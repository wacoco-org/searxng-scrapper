## What is it?

SearXNG is an **open-source, self-hosted metasearch engine** that aggregates search results from multiple providers
(Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc.) while **ensuring privacy**. Unlike Google, 
SearXNG does **not track user data, show ads, or personalize search results**.It can be **self-hosted** 
and configured to scrape various search engines while bypassing tracking and filtering mechanisms.

## How SearXNG Compares to Google

| Feature            | **SearXNG** (Metasearch Engine)                                  | **Google** (Standalone Search Engine)                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Indexing**       | Does **not** have its own search index, fetches from other engines. | Uses its own massive search index built by web crawlers.   |
| **Privacy**        | Fully private, does not track users.                           | Tracks user activity, personalizes results based on history. |
| **Customization**  | Users can choose which search engines to use.                 | No customization—Google controls all indexing & ranking.  |
| **Search Sources** | Uses **multiple search engines** like Bing, DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, etc. | Uses **only Google's own index** and ranking algorithms. |
| **Filtering & Ranking** | Merges results from different engines, applies simple ranking. | Uses complex AI-driven ranking, personalization, and ad-based ranking. |
| **Ads & Monetization** | No ads, open-source, free to use.                           | Google makes money from **ads & personalized search results**. |
| **Self-Hosting**   | Can be **self-hosted** on your own server for full control.   | Google is **controlled by Google servers** and not customizable. |
| **API Support**    | Provides a public and private **search API**.                 | Google has a **paid API (Google Search API)**. |

##  How SearXNG Can Be Used for Scraping
Since SearXNG aggregates results from multiple sources, it can be **used as a scraper** to extract search results
programmatically.

by default scrapping isnt allowed, but you can easly override that by modifying settings.yml and add

```
server:
   limiter: false
   method: "GET"

search:
 formats:
   - html
   - json
```

### Why Use SearXNG for Scraping?
- **Avoid API fees** (Google and other scrapper providers charges for their Search API).
- **Bypass rate limits** by switching between multiple engines.
- **Extract data from different sources** in a single request.
- **Customize the scraping process** with different query parameters.
- **Proxy Support for IP Rotation** Easily integrate with Tor, paid or free proxies for IP rotation


---

## Can You Scrape Unlimited Data?
Well, By default, SearXNG changes the User-Agent and request headers on every request to make it look like different
browsers.
However, it does not change the IP address unless a proxy or Tor is configured.!
**If SearXNG rotates both the IP address and user-agent (browser identity), 
it becomes much harder for search engines to detect that requests are automated.** 
This would **reduce the chance of getting blocked** and could, in theory, allow **unlimited scraping**.


---

## IP Rotation: 

SearXNG **does not rotate IPs by default**, meaning all requests come from the same server.
Search engines **track IPs and can block your requests** if you scrape too aggressively.

I personally tested searching over 1 400 keywords and got total 33 241 url links using same ip, and I have not encountered any problem.

so **there are 3 ways to Rotate IP Addresses in SearXNG**

* **Using Tor (Free but Slow, Many Sites Block It)**
* Edit settings.yml

```
     outgoing:
      proxies:
       all://:
         - socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050  # Route traffic through Tor
```
* **Using Paid Proxy Services (Fast & Reliable, Costs Money)**
  * Edit settings.yml with rotating proxy provider:

```
      outgoing:
       proxies:
        all://:
         - http://username:password@proxy1.com:8000
         - socks5://proxy2.com:1080
```

* **Create you own proxy (free)** 
  * there are several open-source options to create your own proxy for free



# App

The application is built using Spring WebFlux, which is non-blocking and reactive.
WebClient is used instead of RestTemplate to make asynchronous HTTP requests.

**This App can be deployed as a standalone service that serves search results via**

```
GET /api/v0/search?keyword={your_query}&narrowing={optional_domain}

```
the api takes 2 request param, a keyword and a site, site is optional param, its used to narrow the
search result, for example if you search a name, and you want to narrow the search result, 
you use site, Github for example

```
GET http://localhost:8081/api/v0/search?keyword=java&narrowing=github.com

```
now the search result will only contain github domain

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce603e18-2ef4-466c-bc02-d967af2383c9)

when using the api. response looks like this

```
[
    {
        "title": "java · GitHub Topics",
        "url": "https://github.com/topics/java",
        "description": "GitHub is where people build software. More than 100 million people use GitHub to discover,
